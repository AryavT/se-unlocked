**Michaela:** [00:00:00] Hello, and welcome to the software engineering unlocked
podcast. I'm your host, Dr. Mikayla. And today I have the pleasure to talk to
Allison McMillan. Allison is an engineering manager at GitHub, and one of the
hosts of the parent driven development podcast. Allison has worn many hats,
including startup founder, community builder at the university of Michigan, or
managing director of a national nonprofit.
Alison is also a mother of two young children and very outspoken about the
problems, especially new mothers face that want to stay in tech and progress in
their career. So I'm super thrilled to have her on the podcast today to be able
to pick her brain about how it is to work for GitHub and how she managed to have
such a striving career, but at the same time, taking care of two little ones.
So Alison, welcome to the show.

**Allison:** [00:00:49] Yeah. Hi, I'm so happy to be here.

**Michaela:** [00:00:51] Yeah, really great. So Alison, maybe let's start from
the beginning. So I said, you're a mother, you're working for GitHub. You have
this podcast. So how did it all start?

**Allison:** [00:01:02] Uh, yeah. So how it all started. Well, I was
actually working in the nonprofit world and decided to learn how to code.
And so I took a Rails Girls, the first Rails Girls workshop that was offered
in Washington, D.C. Took a Rails Girls workshop. I actually didn't expect to
really enjoy it, but at the end of the day, I loved it, and I'm lucky that D.C.
is a really just awesome, inclusive community. Really welcoming of folks who
want to learn and it was just really friendly. And so I'm from there, I
continued to learn, became a software developer, and when I had my first child,
which was a number of years before I started working in GitHub, it
was a really tough transition for me. And I found that it was really hard to
find outlets, to find people to talk to, especially mothers, but just parents
in general, it was just really challenging.
So I set up a little bit of a support network for myself, just via Twitter and
nice people who agreed to talk me through some of the hard stuff that I was
going through. I was there for a little while, and then I moved on to a
different job, which was really great in terms of a work life balance, and a lot
of folks ahead that had young children.
And then a little while ago before I had my second, I was just sort of
thinking about new opportunities, thinking about options and had a chat with a
friend who worked at GitHub, and she said there is an engineering manager
position open and had just really, really great conversations with the folks
that were there and that's how I ended up there a couple of years ago.

**Michaela:** [00:03:00] Yeah very cool! So actually, you don't have a
traditional background; I get from your story. So you've somehow switched
careers and started programming after you did something else before, or how
does that really work?

**Allison:** [00:03:15] Yeah, I was a political science major. I was a
political science and near East history. So nothing to do with code or
even remotely related to sort of tech, et cetera. And I worked in the nonprofit
world for a number of years and then I actually launched a startup that I ran
for a little over a year and as I was working with a few friends who were
developers, just in terms of what the MVP would look like, et cetera. I found
myself getting really frustrated at not knowing some of the constraints
and some of the parameters and I also felt like if I was gonna start this tech
startup based on an online platform, I really had to understand more about what
programming was. I mean, at that time, I didn't even know that the command line
was a thing that existed.
And so again, Rails Girls was sort of just, I had a friend from the D.C. tech
startup scene that was running the first Rails Girls workshop and it looked
interesting. And like I said, I actually expected to hate it. I sort of grew up
in a very traditional households where the expectation and the message was that
really as a woman, math and science wasn't my thing.
And I was never really very good at math and science in school. So I expected to
not enjoy any part of the day, I was like, I'm going to go because I need to go
because this way I'll have a background and I'll be able to have better
conversations with the folks that I'm working with.
And at the end of the day, I had something deployed to Heroku and it was a
little to do list app and it was so exciting! And I had come across
some error message and fixed some bugs and I was like, Oh, this is so
much more interesting than I originally anticipated.
And so I just sort of kept teaching myself, doing tutorials, spun up
my first sort of practice site, which is just a place to put meal and
recipe ideas for my partner and I. And like I said, D.C. is really awesome.
There was a lot of co-working. There's a lot of co-working that happens.
So I would do co-working before the D.C. rug or Arlington Ruby event.
And tons of folks volunteered to read over my code and give me some feedback
or talk to me about, I mean, I remember sitting in a coffee shop and someone
saying, Oh, have you heard of testing yet? Do you know what testing is?
And I was like, I have no idea. And so they just talked me through;
this is what testing is, and this is what the goals are and here's some
examples. And then they wrote my first test with me, just really, really
kind individuals that gave me both confidence, and a place to start from.

**Michaela:** [00:06:34] Oh, that sounds really inspiring I think. What a
really good story. So, and then when you. Well expecting your second child
and you thinking a career change is now the right thing to do (laugh). How
did that whole thing start? So how did you approach GitHub?
You said that a friend told you about the position and you were thinking
already that you would like to change now, and when you started, how was that?
How was it being a new mother and then starting at a new place, new work,
new environment?
And I can imagine it's quite a lot. I mean, when I got my, my second child,
I was like, all hands (chuckle)!
I needed all hands on deck, just at home, you know?

**Allison:** [00:07:19] Yeah, well, actually my first programming job was just
before my first child. So actually because GitHub had been the third or fourth
company I've worked at in tech, I guess fourth, if you include a place that I
was a contractor at for a while.
But the third sort of full time gig. So I actually got my first full
time developer job right around when my husband and I were sort of thinking
about starting to try for our first child. And we actually got very lucky
and got pregnant pretty quickly, which was great, but it also meant that
basically like two months into my first ever engineering role, I also had to
tell the team that I was pregnant.
At that time I was working at general assembly. There were a couple of other
parents on the team, but no moms, there were no other women on the team at the
time. So it was definitely scary. I mean, fortunately it was remote,
which I think helped a lot, but it was very difficult and those were
some of my struggles after my first, was that it was just really, I spent a lot
of hours learning and teaching myself and putting time in and doing a lot of
stuff before I had a child and I wasn't expecting my brain to change in
interesting unanticipated ways. I wasn't expecting the
prolonged sleep deprivation. I wasn't expecting just like the less amount
of time that I had outside of work to work on things. So it is really
difficult to be a new mom, whether it's your first or second or
whatever, and also to basically have an infant and also be new to programming.

**Michaela:** [00:09:36] Yeah. Yeah. I also remember I had brain fog for, I think,
six months or something after my first child. And I was like, wow (chuckle),
I cannot think straight.

**Allison:** [00:09:48] One of the most interesting things, because as I
mentioned, it was really hard to find people, especially mothers to talk to.
And I had one conversation with someone, basically, I put out a tweet and I was
like, I don't know if I should stay in the industry or just leave.
I don't know what I'm doing. I really am having a tough time. I would love to
talk to mothers who are programmers, who can just talk to me about sort of what
I'm going through. And I had one conversation with a mom who talked to me
about the ways in which your brain actually changes, because one of the
things that really made me nervous was that I found that all of the techniques
and all of the things that I had done in the past to learn things and to
remember things and to ramp up, a lot of them weren't working anymore.
And I was. Sort of freaking out about, I mean, at one time I
was like, Oh God, what if I can never learn anything again for the rest of my
life? (laugh)

**Michaela:** [00:09:56] (grinning) Yeah.

**Allison:** [00:09:57] But one of the conversations that I had with mum talked
about your brain chemistry changing and how sometimes as a result of pregnancy
and having a baby things change in your brain and so sometimes your go to
methods or the things that you have been leaning on to learn, or some of the
processes that you've had, in the future, you really have to break those down
and revisit them and figure out, Okay. What new thing works? What are some
things that you can try? What are some different approaches so that you can
figure out in this new world, essentially what sticks now?

**Michaela:** [00:11:35] Yeah. So in my experience, for me, it was a temporary
thing, but because you don't know how long that phase will be, it's super scary.
So, as I said, I had brain fog and I was in this really strange state six
months after birth, I think, where it was really hard to remember or to
concentrate, to focus, but it changed after what it changed.
And I would say I'm almost normal again (laughing).
Four years after I'm almost normal. But yeah. I have never heard of the
chemistry changing, but surely with the hormones and everything it does. Right.

**Allison:** [00:12:16] Yeah.

**Michaela:** [00:12:17] And so now you are in engineering manager, you're
actually a manager of managers, right?

**Allison:** [00:12:24] Yes.

**Michaela:** [00:12:25] At GitHub.
So what's your role there? Can you tell me a little bit about that? What's your
day to day work? What do you do?

**Allison:** [00:12:32] Yeah. So I run a department, an engineering
department that's focused on communication and collaboration. So it's
a variety of teams that. Focuses on different features and different things
that we work on related to communication and collaboration.
My day to day is a variety of things. Sometimes I meet meeting with the other
department heads in my org. I do a few skip levels every
week. I do a lot of one-on-ones and I do a lot of just, I try every day to roll
through one of the teams that are in my department,
which sort of means I'd just like get a sense of like what they're
talking about, what major like technical problems are they solving right now.
What are the things that are most important to them? Both in terms of team
dynamics, as well as relating to other teams, collaborating across
GitHub with other engineering teams. And a lot of it is getting a sense of
where there are blockers and what I can help unstick or help solve or help
listen about. So I would say my days vary, but that's a good amount of it.

**Michaela:** [00:13:59] So when you say you're having meetings, Madame, is that
face to face or is that virtual? Because, GitHub is quite a remote company. Is
it completely remote or is it partly remote?

**Allison:** [00:14:13] Not completely. I think we're between 60 and 70% remote.
So there's a headquarters in San Francisco and then there are a few smaller
offices around the world, but most people are remote.

**Michaela:** [00:14:30] And what about your teams? Are they remote or are they
also partly remote and partly at the headquarters or at different locations?

**Allison:** [00:14:37] The two managers and like a small handful of engineers
on those teams work at headquarters, but a lot of them are, and even - Because
we're such a remote company - even folks that technically work from
headquarters often do work from home days or they're in the office a little bit
in and out of the office a lot. Because if you're in the office, but the whole
rest of your team is remote then are you really in the office? (chuckle)
So people, I think, pick - even if they are close to an office - they pick what
works well for them, so all of our processes, everything that we do is done
with a remote mindset.

**Michaela:** [00:15:24] Okay. But you are completely remote, right?

**Allison:** [00:15:27] Yes.

**Michaela:** [00:15:29] So when you try to get a feeling of what is
everybody doing and how are they communicating, what are your go to strategies
for making that remote work? Because it's hard. In my experience,
it's harder than if you're at an office. You just have to have more processes
around more strategies and over communicate a little bit.
What is your thought on that?

**Allison:** [00:15:53] Yeah, definitely. I mean, for me, the first
few weeks were definitely a lot about watching Slack to just
get a sense of how teams interact with each other? What's the vibe?
Having a lot of one on one conversations to get a
sense of different body language or things like that.
We do a lot of video. All of our meetings or our video meetings. So
it's really helpful just to get a sense of how chatty different
individuals are, or not. So you can have a baseline so
that then you can tell when something feels like it's off or when you
feel like it's good to send a check-in message for some reason.
It's also paying attention to a lot of the little things.
So somebody might say, Oh, I'm feeling really tired tonight.
Or, Oh, I had a kid who is sick or kid who is up for a few hours.
Or, Oh, this really exciting thing happened this week.
So it's paying attention to those things as well. In terms of checking in on
things, each of the managers that worked for me and
manage their team, they all have cadences that they've set up with their
team. So some teams use Geekbot or some other way to do a virtual standup and
mention in Slack what they worked on yesterday, what they're working on today.
They'll often have some sort of weekly sync meeting. And I will either try to
jump into those just to be a fly on the wall or read any notes or anything
afterwards.
And I think a lot of it is having a good amount of trust.
So I trust that the folks that I manage are going to raise any issues or
any concerns with me in our weekly one-on-ones. And I
think that I have to trust them, they have to trust me.
I think it's really hard to have a remote culture when you're worrying about,
if there is an issue or a question are they going to bring that up to me?
Or is this team really working? Or those sorts of things.
It's really hard to establish, mostly, it's really hard for other folks to
get into a good flow when they feel like they have to answer your questions
all the time.

**Michaela:** [00:18:54] So I think that probably starts already with the
hiring process.
So when you are looking for people to join, especially a remote team, you
probably look at specific mindsets and also qualities of people where they will
strive in a remote environment. Would you agree?
And if so, what would you look for?

**Allison:** [00:19:15] Yeah, definitely. So communication is
big.
One of the things that's really interesting to look for is how
do people recognize situations and figure out what an appropriate response is?
If there's a conversation that's happening in Slack and
there's a lot of people involved or it's getting confusing, or it seems
like it's getting a little heated, how does that person know?
So sometimes we'll ask
questions about situations where you had a conflict with someone and how you
resolved it, especially in a remote culture.
Sometimes it's pinging the person directly or saying
in a group chat, Hey, I actually think this
topic is bigger and, it can help reuse issues and repos, et cetera, for,
for everything. So something like, I'm gonna write up an issue that captures
everyone's thoughts and everyone please comments on it within the next 24 hours.
Sometimes synchronous meetings are good, but also when you're working across a
lot of different time zones, it's not fair for people in the edge case time
zones to always have to be accommodating to everyone else's time zone.
So we try to do things like write up an issue. Or I'm gonna
plan a time later this week that we can all meet via video call to talk about
this synchronously and how that moves forward really depends on the team.
Right? It depends on the team.
It depends how long the team has been working together. It depends what they're
most comfortable with. But I would say in terms of interviewing, definitely
asking about conflict resolution in general, how they communicate, how do you
communicate when you're stuck or when you need help? Things like that.

**Michaela:** [00:21:22] Yeah. So I was talking with life singer from
Automattic and Automattic is a completely remote company. And for example,
what they do is they write everything down. There is a WordPress site,
obviously (chuckle), for everything that they would do. So every project
that they do or every team has their own instance of a blog, and then they
write everything down there. So you can always go and look at those written
down conversations and find your way through that. Do you have something
similar at GitHub?

**Allison:** [00:21:57] Yeah, we use a lot of issues and repos, so
every team has their own repo. Sometimes it's where the code is.
And sometimes it's more a repo for internal team questions or documentations
or things like that that document how we work, onboarding,
those sorts of things. We make pretty liberal use of issues and a lot
of labels on those issues, so that it's really easy to search for something
and to find it. If you're looking for not just bugs, features, et cetera, but
also if you're looking for weekly sync notes or stand up notes or anything
like that.
And then the other thing that we use a lot is team discussions. So on GitHub,
you can you can have teams and often times those discussion boards are
used for posting information about the week or about what was accomplished
or something that's really important for your team to know.
And they're often published for the whole company. And the whole company
doesn't get notified when they're published, but if I ever wanted to look at
what was going on in a different team.
If something came up and I was curious about whether a different team
would be interested in collaborating on something; that's a good place to
look or Slack. We use a lot of Slack, we have a lot of channels and it's not
uncommon for somebody to pop into another team Slack channel and be like,
Hey, we're thinking about this idea. Would you be interested in being CC'd on
the issue or being part of that conversation, et cetera?

**Michaela:** [00:23:57] So one of the things that triggered the thing that you
said before about conflict resolution and communication is code reviews. I
immediately had to think about code reviews because I think code reviews resemble
similar issues where you have like written communication and topics can get a
little bit heated and one of the strategies to resolve that is also going out
of this code review mode via for example, tooling, or I get up or what not, and
having one-on-one conversations. Either pick up the phone or call
somebody or walk over and discuss it in person or write the document or
take one step back and say, okay, it seems there is more disconnect here. Let's
revisit the whole topic or architecture what the discussion is about.
So I would like to know how are code reviews seen at GitHub?
How do you do code reviews? Is every team doing code reviews?
And as you are the manager of managers, you probably have insights in
different teams. Do you see differences? Similarities? I would like to know
everything about that.

**Allison:** [00:25:07] Yeah. I think there's no one uniform
way that we do code reviews it at GitHub. I think one of the really nice
things about GitHub is that there's very little, that's actually prescribed
as you must do something this way.
Managers are really given flexibility to work with their teams and
figure out based on the project, based on the size of the team, based on
the geographic distribution, et cetera. There's a lot of leeway to say
this works for us. So we're going to do it this way or not do it this way,
et cetera.
I would say that in general code reviews definitely happen. I think
that there are a few basic, I don't want to say rules, but cultural
practices that are followed, I think one of the most important things in code
reviews is kindness. I think that when people do code reviews and at least
from what I've seen.
They really think about how things are phrased or how to suggest
options as opposed to using words like 'you should', or 'if you just',
things like that. Sometimes doing a code review is actually part
of our interview process.

**Michaela:** [00:26:30] Okay, Interesting.

**Allison:** [00:26:31] It's actually one of my favorite things to do as part
of it, personally. And it is my personal take, not like a GitHub stance,
but it is one of my favorite things to do as part of a hiring process.
Because I think that you can tell so much about especially at a remote
company where a lot of the interaction is going to be through code reviews.
You can tell so much about a candidate by how they review a pull request.
Because I think that, for example, confidence is a huge aspect of being able
to do good work with other folks remotely. So if you have someone on
your team that's constantly reviewing code with really like, why didn't you do
this? Or you should have just done this. Or if you had simply done this. If
the phrasing isn't kind and thoughtful, then it's also really easy to say to
yourself, Ugh, I'm just such a bad programmer, what am I even doing here?
Whereas different sort of language or prompts that can be used. I think one
of the - this is like sort of code review, but sort of not code review - two
others things related are we talk a lot about pull request descriptions.
So what is a good pull request? For someone to be able to review your code
effectively, what does a good PR look like? So a GIF, if
there's, if there's functionality involved, if it's something complex, really
making sure to break it down and to spend time on that pull request
description. What are you talking about? Why are you talking about it?
What are other options that were considered, but that
didn't go down that path, or maybe went down that path and then reverted and
tried something new. What is important context for either anyone
who's jumping into review the code for them to know, or even for future you to
know about. What I found is that pull requests with good descriptions
often get revisited time and time again, when you're looking for, Oh, how
did that relate to this other team? Or what was that piece
that we pulled in or they approach there; I think that that's really
important. Then the other thing that's a little bit more related to
pull requests, but a little bit code review related, is that in
our department Slack channel, I have a Slack bot message that posts
on Fridays that asks people to post an interesting pull
request that they authored or read, and what was interesting about it or what
they learned as a result. So that's the way to take code review or
take the work that you're doing or that the work where you code reviewed
somebody else and showcase it to a broader audience to say,
I was so impressed by this, or this is a really interesting approach
and I learned about this thing. Or even highlight a code review conversation.
It's a great place to say, Oh, this conversation happened via code review.
The approach was really thoughtful and really excellent. And I really
appreciated the conversation that occurred as a result.

**Michaela:** [00:29:56] Yeah, so much that you just described resonates very
much with me. And while I give for example code reviews workshops, and one of
the things is the feedback that I always go through with the people, because I
think it's so important. It's so crucial how you phrase, as you said, how you
phrase the feedback and it's just very different if you demand something or if
you ask a question and it should be a sincere question. A genuine question
and not that you just package it into, I actually want to say you must, and I
make a question out of it; question mark at the end. I think people can,
even though it's written conversation, people can feel where you're coming from
and it's the same. What's really important is that it's about the code. It's
not about the person. So for example, instead of saying, well, you have to
close the socket, you say, this code doesn't close the socket. It's a very
different conversation.

**Allison:** [00:30:55] Yeah, Absolutely.

**Michaela:** [00:30:56] And as you said, in the studies that we did at
Microsoft, we saw the same thing that if you have a very good description of
your change - change description - that's saving so much time and not even
time, but also the feedback value that you got back from that is
quite different. So if you don't have a lot of description, there are not
good descriptions. It's really about the quality, not the length, but if
you have a good description of your changes, that people can understand
what's actually going on and help you much better and give much better feedback.
So that's really, really important. And I love that you take PRS and
look through them because that's also one of the things that I always
suggest, is to make a review of your review from time to time. Really look into
how are we actually giving reviews? What are we learning? Where are we stuck?
Maybe where are our bottlenecks? Things like that. I really
liked that idea of highlighting how you learn through code reviews,
because it's one of the really good side effects, if not even outcome.
The primary goal of code review is that you're actually learning something and
that you're communicating with each other.

**Allison:** [00:32:06] Yeah. Yeah.

**Michaela:** [00:32:08] Yeah. I love that. So what about testing? Can you tell
me a little bit about testing at GitHub? Do you have automated tests? Do you
have manual testing as well going on? And what's your philosophy behind testing?

**Allison:** [00:32:24] Yeah, we have a lot of automated tests and
writing tests is definitely a very important part of being a conscientious
developer, making sure that you're also testing the code that you're writing
the feature that you're building, et cetera. Some teams have manual
testing as well. It really depends on how complex the product is and what that
looks like. But I think in terms of testing, we sort of follow mostly
standard best practices. I don't know if there's anything that we do that's
particularly unique or, or out of the, out of the ordinary, other than
tests are good and they should be written.

**Michaela:** [00:33:10] And do you know, for example, for every change that
you have, or even every pull request, do you have suggestions or guidelines
around that every pull request should have a test with it or a test suite, or
is there some coverage criteria that engineers must adhere to or something
like that?

**Allison:** [00:33:33] Like I said, at GitHub, there are very few musts.
It's not a hard requirement that everything, that's every single PR,
must have a test because that isn't always necessarily the case or necessary.
But if it's new functionality, if it's changing functionality, if there is
there always tests that are run.
So the expectation is that there are tests that cover that change. And if
there is functionality that's changing or being introduced, et cetera, then
there are tests that should be included in that. And if the person, I
think this is rare, but if for some reason, the person doesn't include a test
and their original PR, I think it's guaranteed that somebody in a code review
will comment on either suggestions around a test or comments around a test,
et cetera.

**Michaela:** [00:34:24] And so you said you actually learned Rails, so Ruby on
Rails, right?

**Allison:** [00:34:30] Yes.

**Michaela:** [00:34:31] Is that also what's fueling GitHub? Can you tell me a
little bit about the tech stack behind?
I think I remember that Ruby is one of the criteria, but is there more?
What do you have to know if you want to apply for GitHub, for example?

**Allison:** [00:34:47] It's a lot of Ruby and Rails.
There is also some Go and I think there's more and more Go popping up.
And then there are also some teams that focus primarily on
JavaScript and React and have a lot of no Ruby and Rails and more
React, Go, that sort of stack.

**Michaela:** [00:35:15] How would the hiring process look like?

**Allison:** [00:35:17] The hiring process differs a little bit team team by
team or department by department, but generally there's an initial call with
the talent partner. And then we do a few interviews.
There is usually a technical component where you're doing some technical
interview.
Oftentimes that's a short take home, but it can take other forms. And then
there's usually some again, video call technical portion where it's active
conversation. There is a values or leadership principles section where we
talk about what our GitHub values are and ask questions around that.
There's always an interview or a chat with the hiring manager. So the person
that is related to the team that you would be joining and then we also do a
diversity inclusion and belonging interview, and there are folks at the company
who gets special training to be on that interview rotation.
And those are questions around, how aware are you of diversity inclusion?
How do you think about diversity, inclusion and belonging, et cetera, so that
we make sure that the folks that are joining GitHub care about those sorts
of things.

**Michaela:** [00:36:42] Okay. And it sounds really interesting because GitHub is
remote or a large part, as you said, is remote.
Is it only US remote or is it worldwide remote?

**Allison:** [00:36:52] It's worldwide remote, although we can't hire in
every country or even every state in the US so I know that on our job site,
I believe there's a link that talks about where we can hire, I don't know
all of the locations off the top of my head, but there are some restrictions
in terms of where we can actually hire folks from,

**Michaela:** [00:37:18] But it's not only US. It also Europe.

**Allison:** [00:37:20] Yes, definitely

**Michaela:** [00:37:23] And South America.

**Allison:** [00:37:24] Yeah. Australia.

**Michaela:** [00:37:27] And Asia probably. Okay. Very cool. So I know that you
are quite an remote advocate and that you like the remote work.

**Allison:** [00:37:35] I do.

**Michaela:** [00:37:36] Can you tell me a little bit about what you see that
it's enabling for you?
So you choose a remote workplace and you told me that even before working
at GitHub, you also worked already remote.
Why are you choosing that work style and what are the benefits that you see?

**Allison:** [00:37:55] I have been working remotely for I think around
eight years now. And even before, when I was working in the nonprofit world,
the organization that I was at, we started all co-located in an
office in Washington, D.C. and as the organization grew, we recognized the
benefits of having folks around.
At that point, It was just around the country, around the United States, and we
recognize the benefit of having folks around the U.S. And so one of the
things that I set up there was actually our first set of remote staff.
And by the time I left, we were about 50% remote 50% in person. And for me,
part of that was also making sure that the folks that were co-located in the
office were taking work from home days.
We're taking just days where they were not in the office. So that they got a
sense of what it was like to be remote, what some of the pain points
were, et cetera. It led to better team collaboration and communication,
et cetera. I love working remotely there are a number of reasons.
First, I think that it enables me to do a lot, it enables me to
pack a lot of different things into my day. So I have two young kids. I don't
always get to shower in the morning. It's nice that I work remotely and can sort
of add that into my day whenever. It's nice that I can
go to my fridge and eat leftovers or snacks or whatnot for lunch.
I think that I save a lot of money by not eating out. And then
also on the money side of things with child's care, when you have to add in
commute time to the number of hours that you need to pay childcare
professionals or daycare or whatnot, it can add up really, really, really
quickly because obviously if you're working 40 hours a week and you have a
commute or something,
whoever is taking care of your child or children is working more than 40 hours a
week and so there's overtime, there's all sorts of additional
complexity that goes into it. I also think one thing that I love
about working remotely is that I get to work from a variety of different places.
So in D.C., for example, all of the Smithsonian museums, they're free for
entry. They all also have internet. They all have have wireless. And so
I'll work from the portrait gallery or I'll work from The Renwick or the
natural history museum. If I feel like going downtown into D.C.,
there are a lot of really cool places and spaces that I can work from
and I find that on days where I'm less motivated or I'm working on something
that's a little bit more abstract and I just need open spaces or
inspiration, or I don't know what it is. I love being able to walk
around completely different places and then sit down on a
bench and jot some notes down or things like that.
Taking breaks to take a walk during the day. There are a
lot of things. I also with two young kids, it's nice
because I can organize my day how it makes sense. So I have
my usual working hours, but if for some reason my son has something going on
at preschool or moving a little bit slower in the morning and therefore
drop-off takes a little longer. Instead of having to get really frustrated
with my kids and be out the door, out the door, we need to get out the door
out the door.
I'm going to start my day, 20, 30 minutes late. And in the evening after
they're asleep,
I can always like open up computer and read a few emails or catch up on anything
that I feel like I need to catch up on, et cetera. So it's nice. The converse of that
is that when you work at a company with people around the world,
It's always regular business hours for someone. So you really need to
be very disciplined in turning off notifications or closing your computer
and saying, I am separating myself from my work day. I am not working. I will
not work until this time. Because it's really easy to
at 8:30, when my kids are asleep, it's sometimes really easy for me to
open up my computer. Because I'm doing some other personal stuff, get
involved in a work conversation, and end up all of a sudden it's
10:30 or 11:00 PM. and I realized that I accidentally worked for
two hours instead of rested and relaxed.

**Michaela:** [00:43:01] Yeah. I can see so many things that you said. One of
the things that I love the most is lunchtime. So my husband and I are both
working remote and we always have lunch together. And I think that's one of the
biggest things that why I love remote so much. Just those 30 or 40
minutes that we just spent together and have lunch every day.
And it's just our quiet time because you never know how it's going to
be in the evening when the kids have to go to sleep (chuckle)
and things like that. So I really enjoyed that very much.
So but remote work isn't, as you said, there are also
obstacles, drawbacks, and things you have to be aware of.
What would you say are the best strategies to make it work? What are the
obstacles we have to overcome and what would you do about them?

**Allison:** [00:43:51] Yeah. I think that one of the most important things
is figuring out what your working style is. So is it enough to have,
I do recommend having some dedicated space in your home,
that is your office area, but is it an office, do you really need to
get out of the house
and co-work? For me, one of the really important things, I wake up, I
get dressed every day. That's really important to me in terms of I am
getting dressed and starting my work day. I can not be productive
in my pajamas, Can't do it. I have a separate place that I go to.
I also, especially in colder months, I make sure that I'm co-working with
friends, at least once a week. Because otherwise I've definitely had times in
the past where I'll randomly be in a little bit of a bad mood
or something feels off and I stop and think, and I realized that I have
not left the house for five days except to maybe do pick up and drop off
or something like that.
So making sure that you know yourself and are building those things
into your schedule. One thing that I'm really bad at that I try always
to be better at is I really need to be getting out of my house more, not
just co-working, but also taking a break in the afternoon because I feel
like I get so focused on work and the things that I'm doing or meetings or
whatever, that it's hard for me to take a break and take a walk, et cetera.
And I don't have any sort of built in walking active, et cetera time because of
a commute. And so that's a thing that I'm always trying to get better
at. Making sure that I'm having, establishing, and maintaining a
healthy lifestyle and healthy habits around working remotely.

**Michaela:** [00:45:54] Yeah, I can see that.
I also, for example, if I'm not picking up my kid from kindergarten,
then sometimes as you said, I'm not leaving my house. And I feel like that's
really unhealthy. And if I go out of the door, it's like, wow, it's there.
the sun is shining. It's wonderful and it really boosts the mood. So
I think we have to be considerate of that, that even if you don't have
this commute, which I'm really happy that I don't have. But on the other
hand, that as you said, that you have some routines around going out of your
house or doing something healthy for yourself.
So Alison, we talked a lot before I let you go, I really want to pick
your brain a little bit more about motherhood or parenthood and
working, because I know that you spend quite
a lot of time researching that topic and why is it so hard for
new mothers or new parents to be in tech or be in the workforce? So what
are your go to strategies to what would you suggest a young mother or
a young father in their early days of parenthood?

**Allison:** [00:47:07] Yeah, absolutely. Well, and it's interesting because one
of the things that I found, so a couple of years ago, I put out this. Big
survey. It's actually still my pined tweet on Twitter, because I do a
conference talk called Baby Driven Development. And every time I do that, I've
given it a handful of times over the last few years,
Every time I do it, I go back to the research. I go back to my surveys and I
update based on new survey results. That that have come in. And
what's really interesting is that it gets a little easier as your kids get
older, but a lot of the challenges still remain the same. Things like
there are a lot of logistics about having kids, no matter how old children are,
there are just so many logistics to who's taking care of them, different hours,
how they're getting from one place to another, sick days, snow days,
all sorts of stuff. So I think that one of the most
important things; the most interesting findings from the survey is that
data around how men and women or how mothers and fathers felt like having
a child affected their career are very different. And I will say I
also have options for non-binary on there,
but I don't have enough data results to be able to include
that into the statistics right now. But the number of mothers who
feel like having a child has negatively affected their career is 60 or a
little over 60%. Whereas for fathers it's much lower. And I think
that part of it is mental load and that a lot of things, it's
expected that moms will take care of.
One of the things that I always talk about to moms and dads about is
recognizing what the parental workload is of each person.
And not just who's taking care of the child or who's cooking dinner, but
who's responding to emails. Who's buying presents for birthday parties.
Who's making doctor's appointments. Who's making sure kids hair gets cut.
There's a million little things. And I think that a lot of that
stuff often falls on, on mothers. So I think that's one really big
thing. And then I think the other really big thing is that your time
outside of work is limited.
So being really intentional about your workday and focused about how you
can hit a bunch of things while you're working. So what work do I do?
That is also fulfilling and also where I'm learning things. So that I
don't have to learn a whole bunch of things outside of work. How can I look at
what I'm doing at work and make sure that I'm getting opportunities or looking
at stuff where I can be learning and advancing and growing through the course of
my Workday, as opposed to having to put in additional hours outside of work
to feel like I'm getting that.
And I think that that's like really a huge aspect of it.

**Michaela:** [00:50:22] Yeah, I liked that very much. And I think it's
changing your mindset, right? Because as you said, it's really hard outside of
the work that you put in work (chuckle) then to do something else. I mean,
there are the kids and you want to spend time with them and with your family,
and it's just, you don't have the same opportunities that you had before.
I mean, I always traveled the world and it was so easy. And if
there was a job opportunity in America and it was good enough, I was like, Oh
yeah, hell yes!

**Allison:** [00:50:53] Sure. Yeah.

**Michaela:** [00:50:55] Where can I sign? It doesn't matter. I find something.
There are Air BnBs or whatnot I have a friend, I would find friends.
It doesn't matter. And right now, even for job opportunities, I'm like,
Oh, sounds really amazing, but I can't do it (laugh) or as you said
outside of work, if you want to do something, something in addition, you
have to, for me for example, a lot of what I do right now is I want to
do what I really love for work so that I don't have to have another thing that
I do to that I really love. (laugh)
So you have to really work on combining the different forces that you
have and I like that advice a lot.

**Allison:** [00:51:40] Yeah. And then one other thing, especially
working remotely, it's so easy to just work all the time when
you're remote. Even a lot of people are like, Oh, I'm sick and I
don't feel great, but I don't have to go anywhere.
So I can work today, but I'll work at a slower pace.
One of the most important things for me has been taking off at least a
day, if not like a couple of days every few months, that is Pure self
care time for myself. So a day where, because you end up having to take
off so many days for like school closings and illness, for all these
random things that are not actual vacation days, because you have to take
them off of work because you have a bunch of other responsibilities.
So I made sure to just take off a day or a couple of days every
here and there. Husband's at work. Kids are in childcare,
preschool, whatever, and it is literally just me and my day. And I also
try to really force myself to not use that day to catch up on
various things around the house that have to get done, to pick a show that
I'm going to watch five episodes of on Netflix, or to meet up with a friend
for coffee.
Or things like that that remind me that I'm
still a person outside of being a mom and being a wife and being an employee
of GitHub, et cetera, that at the core, there is still a person that is me.

**Michaela:** [00:53:17] Yeah. I'm Daydreaming right now imagining myself
doing that, to be honest, that's on my plan.
My older son is now four and I haven't done that yet. I haven't
had a one day off thing yet, because if I have, as you said, something for
work, (laugh) which probably not the best thing, but yeah, I'm dreaming of
that. One day I will do it, but I actually dream of doing it together with
somebody I'm so afraid of being lonely. (laugh)
That I think that's the reason why I haven't done it yet because I don't want to
be lonely and everybody else is working so much. (laugh)
But a good advice. I like that. And I think it's really, really important.

**Allison:** [00:54:02] Yeah. It's amazing. I feel like as parents,
sometimes we don't even realize how tired we are. And so we do that and then
it's like, Oh, Wow! That was great! I need that! (laugh)
Because also it was years before I started doing that.
And then I was like, I wonder what it would be like to just
take a day. It was after my second, it was like, I wonder what it would be like
to just take a day where I'm not doing anything. And it was
amazing. It's as a parent, when you're
only getting three hours of sleep a night, and then one night you get like five
hours of sleep, you feel like you can do anything because you've gotten so
much more sleep than you're used to getting it sort of like that.
For most people, I feel like taking a day off would not seem like
it would make such a difference, but for a parent because
especially a full time working parent, because we're pushing ourselves
so hard in so many different fronts, it really is pretty incredible.

**Michaela:** [00:55:05] Yeah, actually, I'm a little bit afraid of it.
I don't know why, but there's a little bit of a fear creeping in like
if you talk about it and I'm like, yes, I should really do that. And on the
other hand, there's this fear, no, don't do that. I don't know where it's
coming from, but it's there. So. Alison. Thank you so much for talking
