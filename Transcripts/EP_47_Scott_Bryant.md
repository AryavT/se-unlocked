**Michaela:** Hello, and welcome to the software engineering unlocked podcast. I'm 
your host-Dr. McKayla, and today I have the pleasure to talk to Trier Bryant and 
Kim Scott who just released their newest book, 'Just Work'. But before I start, I 
want to tell you more about CodeSubmit. The best take home assignment platform 
to streamline your tech recruiting.
Yes, exactly. This amazing startup is back sponsoring the podcast. Over the last month, they 
introduced a lot of exciting new features, such as live coding within a full 
working IDE, running directly in your browser. CodeSubmit makes it really easy to 
recruit and hire amazing tech talent. They support 64 different languages and 
frameworks and integrate seamlessly with Git.
In the beginning of the year when I was hiring engineers for a startup I worked with,
I used the tool during the interview process for all the candidates and was 
extremely satisfied. Their mission; "real tasks, no brainteasers" resonates a lot 
with me. So I cannot recommend CodeSubmit enough, please check them 
out at codesubmit.io.
That is codesubmit.io, but now back to Trier and Kim, who founded the company Just 
Work, which helps organization and individuals create more equitable workplaces. 
Trier Bryant is a strategic executed leader with distinctive tech, Wall Street, 
and military experience spending over 15 years as the CEO of Just Work.
She previously worked at Astra, Twitter, Goldman Sachs, and led engineering teams 
in the United States Air Force, where she also drove diversity, equity and 
inclusion initiatives. Kim Scott is the author of both successful books, Just Work and 
Radical Candor. Kim was the CEO coach at Dropbox, Qualtrix, Twitter, and other 
tech companies.
She was a member of the faculty at Apple University and before led AdSense, 
YouTube, and DoubleClick teams at Google. So what should I say, except that I'm 
super, super thrilled to have both fantastic and super accomplished women here 
with me. Trier and Kim, welcome to the show. 
[00:02:00]

**Trier:**  Thank you for having us.
[00:02:01]  
 
**Kim:** 
Thanks so much. It's an honor to be here with you. 
[00:02:04] 
 
**Michaela:** Yeah,  I'm really excited. It's also the first interview for 
me, where I have two guests here on my show. So, I'm super excited. And 
I normally start my show with asking my guests how they actually landed in tech. 
So a little bit about your journey and here, I think it's really interesting  
because you both have such a wild, a little bit wild, and very diverse 
backgrounds.
So Trier, I want to start with you. You served in the United States Air Force. 
I mean, it already makes me wow... Right? And you led engineering teams 
there. How did you get into the US Air Force? And how did you get into software 
engineering and how was that experience for you?
[00:02:44]

**Trier:**  Yeah. I actually got into the Air Force through, by attending the 
Air Force Academy.
So I attended the Air Force Academy for four years for college and then got 
commissioned as an officer. And I actually ended up wanting to be an engineer. I majored 
in systems engineering because my dream job was actually to work on the planes, 
the future planes at the Air Force was going to build and take feedback from the 
pilots and make changes.
That's not what I ended up doing. I ended up doing cybersecurity, but that's 
what I wanted to do. And here we are. So.
[00:03:21] 
 
**Michaela:** Okay. And cybersecurity, so did you do that as the US 
Air Force, or where did you do that? 
[00:03:29]

**Trier:**  I did that, I did that for seven years, active duty in the Air 
Force, cybersecurity, primarily defense.
So preventing adversaries from getting into the US military's networks. 
[00:03:42] 
 
**Michaela:** Oh, that sounds very, very exciting. How was that experience
for you working with probably quite a lot of men at that point?
I mean, maybe that's a very naive picture of the US Air Force. 
I don't know. Maybe it's like equal, but I mean, engineering generally is
very heavy, you know, unbalanced with diversity.
So how is that in the US Air Force? 
[00:04:04]

**Trier:**  Yeah. So that's actually then how I usually say I stumbled into 
my passion with diversity equity, inclusion, DEI, and that was because there 
weren't a lot of women in the military, particularly as an officer in the 
officer Corps. And as a black woman, there definitely were not a lot of black 
officers as well.
And even fewer black women officers. So that's when I really started to understand
what could we do as an institution, both at the Air Force Academy level, Air Force, 
and DOD to increase representation in the US Air Force. 
[00:04:40] 
 
**Michaela:** And then you have also been at other companies like Twitter and 
other tech companies. How was that experience, is it different at the US air 
force or is that very similar?
where you say, well, people are similar or work. Cultures are similar, you know, 
problems are similar. 
[00:04:55]

**Trier:**  Yeah. I think that every organization has similar 
problems. I mean, cause you're dealing with people, but how you may approach 
them or solve for them will be unique and different. But every company and 
organization and industry has their own cultures and subcultures within those 
cultures.
So it's been quite an experience going from a military type of a culture to 
then, you know, Wall Street and Goldman Sachs and then two tech companies. But I 
think ultimately what's really exciting is that there is really great challenges and 
really incredible smart people across all of them, but they're vastly vastly 
different, for sure.
[00:05:32] 
 
**Michaela:** Could we generalize that it's more, that's more 
hierarchy there in the US Air Force, at least that's what I would think that 
it's very radical and very like order and the, you know.
[00:05:44]

**Trier:**  Yeah, there's definitely a chain of command. You 
know exactly how many people in levels there are between you and the commander 
in chief, the president of the United States, but there's a, I think 
the biggest difference from a culture perspective is,
in the military, I say, everything that the military does is either to save 
a life or take a life. On Wall Street, everything-and Goldman-was about making a 
dollar, losing a dollar. And then I found at tech, you know, it's really 
just about... What's been really energizing about tech, it's like, what is the 
cool new thing, right?
Like what's the new, cool thing that people want to build or how do you want to 
solve it? And, and, and building upon that. And it's been really interesting, 
but very different cultures as far as like what motivates people to show up
and do the work. 
[00:06:36] 
 
**Michaela:**  Yeah, I can imagine. Yeah. I like it this very, very, to the 
point, abstracted essence of what it means to work somewhere, right?
Like a dollar, a life. And now we say, well, the coolest and newest and shiniest 
thing, even though I think maybe Twitter and, you know, like those tech 
companies are a little bit more advanced. There are a lot of tech companies that 
are quite old school, boring tech companies, where I wonder a lot, like I'm 
doing a study right now on work culture and what motivates people and productivity,
satisfaction, happiness, and a lot of people deal with not that new and shiny thing.
Right? They work with, you know, established technologies and what I've seen from the 
interviews that I did is that people are not only motivated by the 
new and shiniest thing, but really the value also that they bring with 
their product, for example, or sometimes it's just the people that 
you're working with that are very energizing and, bring you motivation.
And I have seen it as quite diverse and really depending on the company and the 
environment, people are very, also adaptable to the environments that they are 
in. When, you know that thing isn't going so well, they can adjust and focus on 
something else. Is that also your experience that, you know, even if you're in a 
workplace where some of the things aren't going that well, depending on what 
kind of things you're focusing on, something else, and people adapt to it?
[00:08:05]

**Trier:**  Yeah, I think that that's one of the things that, you know, 
professionals that you gain with experience is just how to be adaptable and how 
to understand, you know, how to make the biggest impact you can with the 
resources you have and collaborating together efficiently. And I 
think that that's why 'Just Work' the book and the framework that we 
have is really being so receptive to tech companies. Because we need to increase...
We need to, efficiently collaborate. Like how do we 
increase collaboration while also, respecting individuality? And 
that's what Just Work is. Because that's the two by two that Kim gives you.
And if, you know, Kim from Radical Candor, like Kim's going to give you a two by 
two and Kim is going to give you a framework. And it's been really exciting 
to have the framework and the book leveraged in that way that teams 
are able to increase that collaboration. 
[00:09:04] 
 
**Michaela:** Yeah, that's really cool.
I really want to deep dive into that and really understand a little bit more 
about that. But before we go there, I want to ask Kim a little bit about
her background, because this is also super fascinating, right? So you manage a 
pediatric clinic in Kosovo. That's what I read online. And you started a diamond 
cutting factory in Moscow.
I mean, how, why, how did that come about? I mean, this is really a big change. 
We were just on vacation with my kids, and I read this article on a guy that, 
where he was looking for diamonds, and I told about this to my kids and he 
actually found one and proposed with this diamond and that, and he was like, 
yeah, we are going to do that.
And I was like, yes, I didn't even know that it's still a thing. So how did you 
do that? Like how did you diamond cutting or diamond timing companies? How does 
that go? 
[00:09:59]  
 
**Kim:** [00:10:00] Well, so, unlike Trier, I had a very impractical major in 
college. I studied Slavic literature, so it wasn't totally clear when I 
graduated, how I was gonna make a living.
And I wound up going to Russia and moving to Moscow and I took a job 
earning $6 a month, working for Moscow Physical Technical Institute. And what I 
was doing there... I was... The reason why I studied Russian was that I was very 
interested in ending the cold war and then the Berlin wall fell and it 
solved... That problem solved itself.
So I wound up in Moscow doing a study on military conversion, sort of swords 
into plowshares. And that was very interesting, but then that company 
wound up pulling out of Russia and I wanted to stay in Russia. And so, as all 
things, this is what Trier and I are going to talk a lot. It all comes back to 
relationships.
So through a friend of a friend, I wound up a job in Moscow with this
diamond cutting factory. And that was actually where my interest in management 
started. I had to hire these diamond cutters, these workers, and I 
thought that they wanted... They were going to just want to be paid. I didn't 
have any notion of management at the time. I was 22 years old, and I thought it 
would be easy, cause I had dollars and they had rubles, and dollar's worth
something and rubles is were worth nothing. So I went to them and I just said,
I'm going to give you this salary, and I just assumed they 
would take the job, but no, they didn't just want money. They wanted a picnic.
And so we went out on a picnic together. And it turned out... After a bottle of 
vodka, I finally figured out what they really wanted from a leader was someone 
who would give a damn. (Someone) Who would get them out of Russia if things went sideways 
in that country, as they were apt to do at that time. And, and so that was all 
of a sudden management became much more interesting than being just 
about paying people.
It became about forming relationships. And as Trier said, learning how to 
create environments in which we can collaborate and respect one another. That 
didn't lead me to tech immediately. That was a longer... I wound up in tech
after I graduated from business school and I worked for the federal government.
The only person in my class to do so. Working at the FCC. 
And when I was there... This was, gosh, it was long time ago now...
It was in 1996, but the telecommunications revolution was in full 
swing. And that was actually where my interest in tech began. Working for 
the US government. So, go figure.
[00:12:48] 
 
**Michaela:** Yeah. And so there, you started doing something 
technical or managing technical people? How, how did you... (inaudible) 
[00:12:56] 
**Kim:** So it's very strange. So we were trying at the FCC to end 
the settlement right system. So, it turns out the United States is a net exporter 
of telephone calls. And because we had broken up... The US had broke it up
it's telecommunications, monopoly, these different US telcos 
were negotiating with, PTT that were monopolies and we were losing those 
negotiations. And so we were exporting billions of dollars in what's called 
settlement rights. And those days it was quite expensive. I remember, the man I 
was dating at the time was in Africa and, and I called him and had an hour long 
conversation and wound up with a thousand dollar phone bill.
So that was... remember those days. We forgotten those days.
But that was when I was there. And I...
We were trying to end that. We were trying to bring down the cost of 
international phone calls. And as, we were looking at doing this through 
regulation, I learned about voiceover IP, and I thought, you know what?
That is the solution and I wound up starting an Israeli voiceover IP
company called Deltathree. So that was my foray into tech. I thought,
tech could solve these problems of bureaucracy.
[00:14:14] 
 
**Michaela:** Wow. Yeah. So you founded a lot of companies even in different 
countries and this must be such an
impressive experience as well. I mean, I moved to several countries, lived 
there, established a life there, but even, you know, starting a company is 
another, another step. Right? Like you have to understand how to do that there, 
how people work, how people think. That's really, really impressive. And so you 
both, together, work on Just Work.
You wrote the book, 'Just Work', and now you have a consultancy around that. As I 
understand it, it's like focusing on recognizing, understanding, and preventing 
or fighting work injustice. But if you have to summarize it in one sentence,
how would you say, what's the essence of the book and, why, would people care?
Why should they go and read it? 
[00:15:08] 

**Kim:** So, the essence of the book is about really diagnosing and 
treating the problem of workplace injustice so that we can build the kind of 
organizations where we all want to work, Where organizations that are optimized 
for collaboration, which is humanity's superpower, and organizations in which we 
can all respect one another as Trier said before.
I don't know if that counts as one sentence I bet Trier can do it better than me.
[00:15:34]

**Trier:**  No, I think that's it Kim. That's the essence of the 
book. And then for Just Work the company, it helps leaders and 
organizations build more equitable, productive, and successful workplaces.
But what makes the company unique is that the Just Work framework from the book is 
definitely part of that, but we meet organizations where they are, because 
there's also other things, you know, there's not a silver bullet to 
get this right. You have to have a very comprehensive strategy. And so we 
provide, you know, a full suite of D,E and I solutions and products that, you 
know, can help organizations get there so that they can Just Work. But it 
takes a lot, there's not just one thing
that's gonna get you there, but you have to have a starting place. and one of 
the things that's just so powerful about the book is that, you know, we don't 
have a lot of frameworks. We don't... I have never been familiar with a framework 
that employees can use, that organizations can use, that leaders can use, that 
you can add to your toolkit that's very tactical, right?
And so the fact that Kim has really built this and 
provided this is really powerful. That you can point to something and people can 
easily grasp it and start using it in their everyday work situation. 
[00:16:57] 
 
**Michaela:** So, what you're describing is this diagnostic tool for identifying 
and treating systematic work injustice.
Is that also described in the book? And can you describe it for my listeners? 
How it looks like, how can they imagine it? What does it do? How do we work?
[00:17:13]  
 
**Kim:** Sure. Absolutely. So I think we tend to treat the 
problem of workplace injustice as though we're one big monolithic problem.
And when we treat it that way, it becomes very difficult to cure the problem.
To solve the problem.
And so what we've done is we broken down the problem into its component parts. 
So at the root, the root causes of workplace injustice are bias, 
prejudice, and bullying. And I think too often, we tend to conflate those three 
things. We treat them as though they're all the same thing, but 
they're different.
So bias is sort of not meaning it. It's often unconscious. Prejudice is meaning 
it. It's a conscious belief. And bullying is being mean or meaning
harm. And so each of these attitudes and behaviors demands a 
different kind of confrontation. And then when you add power on top of bias, 
prejudice, and bullying, you wind up with discrimination, harassment, and 
physical violations, and we can walk you through some of the 
solutions that we recommend that leaders can put into place and that upstanders
can use so that they don't get slimed by other people's bad behavior. And that 
we can use when we are the person who's harmed by these attitudes and behaviors. 
And also how we can respond when we get feedback that we are the person who was 
harmed. So in some senses, it's like a six by four. It's a big 
problem, but six by four is not intractable.
So there's bias, prejudice, bullying, discrimination, harassment, physical 
violations. So those are the problems. And then each of us play four different 
roles where either the leader we're the upstander, we are the person who's 
harmed or where the person who's causing harm. And one of the things that Trier 
and I are working on doing is, coming up with very specific interventions for 
each of those problems and roles. 
[00:19:13] 
 
**Michaela:** Yeah, I really liked that. And I think, especially when I was 
younger, I've ended up, I don't know why, I ended up quite often in a situation 
where there was harassment or really bad situations. And I felt like people 
could already smell that they can step over boundaries and be mean, 
be bullying even more, right?
So, I don't know, is that something that you, that you saw, you 
probably did some research around that and, very familiar with?
[00:19:44]  
 
**Kim:** So, I think that it is one of the things that I have found is that when 
we, when we observe workplace injustice or we observe that someone is a 
colleague who we care about is coming into work, having experienced [00:20:00] 
injustice in the society at large. And if we don't do anything about it, if we are
a passive bystander, then I find at least I often wind up feeling quite guilty.
And then, and then that wakes me up. And now all of a sudden, not only am I a 
bystander, I'm also harmed by it, but I also have caused harm by not 
intervening. And so now all of a sudden I'm playing three of those roles. And so 
teaching bystanders to become upstanders is really important.
And then also working with people who are the targets of bias, prejudice, and 
bullying to know how to respond. Cause I think we have a default to 
silence and very often when there is a default to silence, then we 
reinforce the problem. So helping people learn how to choose a response. 
[00:20:58] 
 
**Michaela:** I also think like I'm coming from Europe... and especially in Australia.
I don't want to generalize for the whole Europe now. There was in Austria then, 
when I entered the workforce, I wasn't really expecting that people were really 
nice to me. You know what I mean? Like, the school system here is already that, 
you know, there's like the power hierarchies and teachers can be quite mean and 
you know, the person is the boss, so they can, they have, somehow people are 
expecting the boss to be mean and, you know, to be in power and to be able to 
say mean things.
And over time, where it took me many, many years and you know, many countries to 
work on that. I also changed my perception and I said, well, what happened 
at that point where I felt really shitty as a, you know, as a student, for 
example, with professors or even working at university. Horrible, horrible work 
environment, harassment, but really official harassment, like shouting in front 
of the colleagues.
Like the professor, for example, nobody would stand up. Because [00:22:00] they 
knew it, but they weren't like it wasn't, it wasn't something that you would say, 
oh, it's not allowed. It's not good. We know it, but it wasn't really not 
allowed. And just over time, and those were being in the US I get more sensible 
for it.
And I was like, this was really un-right at that point, I would 
but it wasn't my conscious understanding at that point that this is 
something that is not allowed. How do you see that? Is that, is that a cultural 
thing as well? Or it has to do... I think it's cultural, but it's also probably 
with the age, right?
That you're really young and you're coming into and you don't know what's right,
and what's wrong. Is that allowed or not? And so on...
[00:22:37]

**Trier:**  Yeah, some of that, some of it is culture and how things are 
communicated, but you know what you're, I think that what you're, what you're 
getting to are some gaps within organizations, within their people, HR 
practices. Because there's a need for things to be very explicit and not be 
implicit.
And one of the things that we talk about in the framework is having a code of 
conduct. Right? And it needs to be very clear. So, people can think and believe 
whatever they want, but you can't come into an organization and do and say 
whatever you want. And so in a company to your point, like it has to be very 
clear.
This is not acceptable, or these behaviors and attitudes are acceptable. And 
then another part that we talk about in the framework is having, you know, a 
culture of consent. And that's another one that, you know, Kim and I have spent a 
lot of time talking about, about we're in an organization. Organizations, aren't 
very explicit on a culture of consent.
Right? So like McKayla, you've probably worked at organizations where if we 
said, Hey, was there a culture of consent in your previous organization or 
company? Most people will say, well, yeah, there's a culture of consent. 
No one's going to say no, we don't have a culture of consent, but 
it's implicit.
But those are things where organizations have to make it very, very clear. 
Right? Like in whatever type of documentation employees, reading adhere to that, 
[00:24:00] everyone can point to it. Everyone understands what it is. And the 
other thing that Kim and I have talked about a lot is that in this, you know, 
environment of a pandemic with COVID and people going back into the workplace, 
having that being explicit is really important because it goes beyond, just
you know, these physical interactions. It might be more intimate or personal to 
something as simple as like a handshake, right? This culture of consent in 
COVID is like, what are we going to do with the handshake? It was interesting 
yesterday in my building, someone reached out their hand to introduce themselves 
to me because they're a new member of the staff.
And I was like, I'm never shaking anyone's hand again, but we can like nice to 
me you and pull it out. Right? But like, how are companies thinking about this in 
your organizations or even, you know, you're in a meeting. If someone wanted to 
borrow my pen and didn't ask you just grabbed it, I wouldn't think twice.
Now, if we're in a meeting and you grab my pen and I'd be like, you know what, 
it's yours. Have it. I have plenty on my desk. So, you know, these are some of 
the things that I think there's real opportunity for leaders and organizations 
to really pause, look at the artifacts that they have for their employees that 
help them understand
what is acceptable, what is expected of their behaviors and their actions in the 
workplace. And if there's things missing, then where do we need to add and fill 
some gaps so that we can get it right and it's very clear of as far as like, 
what is expected of people. 
[00:25:22]  
 
**Kim:** And I think also McKayla, I'm sorry you had those experiences in 
school.
It sounds like it was sort of acceptable for professors to bully students. And I don't 
think that's unusual, unfortunately. I think that happens everywhere in 
the world to a certain extent. But I do, I also think it's changing. Well I'm 
an eternal optimist, but I really do. In fact, I learned 
how to deal with bullying from my daughter when she was in third grade.
So she was getting bullied on the playground as happens to children everywhere in 
the world, unfortunately, and her [00:26:00] teachers weren't doing enough 
about it. I mean, one of the things that Trier and I work with leaders on doing 
is creating consequences, but there were no consequences for this kid who was 
bullying my daughter.
And so she and I were talking about how to deal with it. And I was sort of, 
trying to convince her to use what we call an I statement with this little kid 
and to say, I feel sad when you, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And my daughter 
banged her fist on the table. And she said, mom, he is trying to make me feel 
sad.
Why would I tell him he succeeded? And I thought, oh my gosh, she is exactly 
right. And so we talked about it and we realized a You statement is much more 
effective. If an I statement sort of, invite someone in to see things from your 
perspective, a You statement pushes them away. So you can't talk to me like 
that, or you need to stop now or, what's going on for you here?
If it feels like those first two statements might escalate the situation too 
much. But the point is, with the You statement in the face of bullying, you are now in 
the active role and you're making the other person, the person who's bullying 
you, answer your questions. So you're not submitting to the bullying and that is 
really crucial to respond to it.
So I think it's, and I think increasingly leaders are beginning to understand 
that it is a part, whether they're a teacher or a manager or a CEO, they're 
beginning to realize that it's part of their job to tamp down bullying in their 
organizations. Because if humanity's superpower is collaboration, as we were 
talking about earlier, bullying is a collaboration killer, and it might work for 
the person who's bullying, but it's bad for the team collectively.
[00:27:52] 
 
**Michaela:** Yeah. One thing that came to my mind is I love to talk about 
software engineering practices [00:28:00] on this podcast as well. And, 
what I'm wondering sometimes is how, and probably you, as the experts here, you 
thought about that already. How can some of the engineering practices shape our 
culture, or how are you doing that?
And do you think that they can increase or decrease, you know, diversity, equity 
and inclusion? For example, cultural abuse, right? There are also studies on 
biases in culture abuse that, you know, certain types of groups GAD, 
their cultural views rejected for, you know, for no reason or less of a reason 
than other people or what I always saw.
Like the Friday night beer. Well, like I hated the Friday night beer. I don't 
drink beer and, you know, it's very, very stereotypical, but I don't drink beer 
and there was no wine, never, ever a wine, right? Or a coal gore, you know, I 
would even like more, just a soda or something. Right. It's sort of the Citroen.
What is your, what are your thoughts on that and how, how we should, should we 
reflect on it? Is there something around engineering, testing, code reviews, 
even Dev Ops?
[00:29:06]

**Trier:**  Yeah. Okay. It's so interesting, having been an engineer, led 
engineering teams, working at tech companies, working very closely with 
engineering leaders.
There was a lot of things that are problematic in kind of the engineering 
culture and it doesn't have to be, right? That's the part that is so silly.  
That it doesn't have to be that people consist, like continue to perpetuate and 
make a conscious effort not to change their behaviors because it works for that 
person or the status quo.
But we have to challenge the status quo. What are some things that engineering 
leaders and teams can do? One that I was really inspired by... And there's a bunch 
of, there was an article written about it and there was a bunch of tweets on 
Twitter and it got a lot of attention actually from a black engineer that when I 
was at Twitter, my university recruiting team actually hired, but they created

And really getting engineers to change even the language that they 
use, right? Like a black list versus a white list. There's a lot of problematic 
language and language is so important in engineering. And so even like going and 
finding that list and saying, okay, we're going to change some of this language.
We're not going to use, you know, this language anymore because it just 
reinforces bias. And, and our, our minds are very, very powerful. And so I think 
the language that is used within engineering is step one. Right? That's that's 
one. Two, what is really interesting is, I was working with a white man 
engineering leader at a previous company once. And he said, Trier, I have one of the highest 
performing engineering teams at the company and they're all white men. So if 
it's not broke, don't fix it. Like, why would I need, if 
we're performing and we're high performing, like why does it matter that 
everyone on the team are white men?
And I said, wow, like you, you think if you're high-performing with just all of 
these white men on your team, The data and the research is there that 
we know more diverse teams, outperform homogenous teams, right? Imagine what you 
could be if you actually had representation on your team. And I wasn't even my, 
my engineering background didn't even align with what he did, but I pointed to 
an engineer on his question.
This was a team that part of their responsibility was to write algorithms to 
identify hate on a platform. If you look at most platforms, underrepresented 
women, first of all, trans women and black women face the most hate on most 
social media platforms. So if that is the population that experiences the most 
hate, but yet you have a group of white [00:32:00] men that are supposed to 
write the algorithms to do find that hate.
That's problematic right there. We are, I don't even know exactly 
how to do, I don't know how to do your job, but I just know that it's not 
working. Right? And we also know that, these populations are still experiencing 
so much hate on every single platform. And one of the problems is that we don't 
have enough people who look like the populations who can identify that those 
populations have considered the table and have those conversations about like, 
how do you really define that and make it better?
And so I think that, like, we really need to think about representation on the 
teams for... That's inclusive for the problems that we're solving for the 
communities that it impacts the most. 
[00:32:42]  
 
**Kim:** I think that's exactly right. It's so important to be willing, 
to interrupt bias in engineering culture. And there is a lot of it.
And so one of the things that Trier and I work with with engineering leaders to 
do is to begin to disrupt bias. So, there are a couple of points 
to disrupting bias. There are a couple of different elements to this. The first is you need 
to come up with a shared vocabulary. So Trier and I use a purple flag.
So if I wave a purple flag, it means either I've said something biased or 
someone else in the room has. And we know that. Trier and I know that. So,
shared by other teams we've worked with, have used, come again, or I don't 
think you meant that the way it sounded, or please... it doesn't... the words matter. 
But I can't give you the words. Your team has to choose the words that you 
will actually use.
So come up with the words. The second point is you've got to commit to using the 
bias interrupter. You know, that bias is occurring in every single meeting 
you have. So you need to come up with an expectation that bias is going to get 
flagged at least once in every meeting. And then the third thing to 
do is to teach people what to do when they are the person who's 
caused harm when it's their bias, who's being flagged.
So if Trier waves a purple flag at me, I get two choices of what to say back. 
And she has the same two choices when I wave one at her. The first is thanks 
for pointing it out. I'm going to work on not doing that again. Or 
thanks for pointing it out. I don't quite understand what I did wrong.
Can we talk about it after the meeting? And then we do have to talk about it, or 
if we're on video meeting, we can drop a link into the chat that explains it. 
And the reason that it's so important to interrupt bias is that if we don't 
interrupt it publicly and in the moment where we reinforce it. And so I've seen 
this happen, in code reviews. You asked specifically about code reviews all the 
time, where you find that, that people are reviewing
code of someone who's underrepresented very differently from the way 
they're reviewing other people's code. And it's important, this, this brings us 
to the second point. So we've got to interrupt it when we notice it, but we also 
need to quantify it to go out, looking for it, quantify your bias and
this means that if you, if you are in your code review, you can quantify how 
many times someone has negatively reviewed people's code. And then you can take 
a look at whose code they're not going to negatively review it. And if you notice that 
men tend to negatively review women's code more than men's code. Then you know 
that you have identified some bias in your code review.
Another simpler thing that I experienced, I was working with a leadership team 
at a tech company, big tech company, and their bias quantification did not take 
a lot of effort. They noticed that they had not promoted any women to the 
executive team at this company. And the [00:36:00] company had been around for 
about 10 years.
So they knew it was a problem. They knew the problem was not the women who 
worked at the company. They had a lot of great women, so they knew there must be 
something broken in their recruiting process. And so they invited me to their 
credit to join their promotion committee meeting to note. Because everybody on 
the committee was man.
So they thought maybe I would notice something that they themselves had not 
noticed. And, there were two people up for promotion. One, a man, one, a woman.
Both of them had great reputations for being excellent managers, building teams 
that were very highly functioning and very loyal to each of these, 
two individuals, and
they referred to the man who was up for promotion as a great leader. And they 
referred to the woman who was up for promotion as a real mother 
hen. Now, who are you going to promote? The real leader or the real mother hen?
And, and so I pointed this out to them and at first they sort of were like, oh, 
Kim, come on.
It's no big deal. I said, it is a big deal. This is why you're not promoting 
women. It's like the subtle ways that language impacts the way you 
think about people, it is real and you've got, that's why it's so 
important to quantify your bias and then go look and figure out what's wrong and 
not what's wrong with the underrepresented candidates, but what's wrong with 
your hiring processes or your promotion processes or whatever.
[00:37:33] 
 
**Michaela:** So you're saying that we have to be very consciously thinking and 
looking at bias and what's going on to do work. And it looks like it's not just 
work, but it's also work all the time on, you know, improving our collaboration 
our way we work together. More powerful. Yeah. Maybe the last question that I 
have for you too, as you're giving workshops on inclusion, diversity [00:38:00] 
and equity.
So, how do the workshops work? And also who should be on the workshop? Should we 
ask advocates, like people that are already pro diversity, equity and 
inclusion, or should we better have the skeptics participate or a mixture, or 
how are you going about that? Is there a minimum number of people at the company 
that have to take such a workshop to be, to get that ripple 
through in the organism?
[00:38:28]


**Trier:**  Yeah, I think that, you know what we have seen and it's, 
again, it's been so nice to have such a positive response that we can come into 
an organization and do a, Just Work keynote for an hour or a half day workshop. 
And that we're literally leaving people with tactical and practical things that 
they could implement.
And it's for everyone right? Yes, there are, in the frame where we talk 
about, you know, what do you do? Whether any... If you're in either of the four 
roles, like a person who's been harmed, a person who's a upstander, which is a 
bystander who actually intervenes, or if you're the person who has caused harm or a 
leader. And we can do a deeper dive as far as like what leaders and 
organizations should be doing.
But there's something for everyone in the framework. Now, Just Work the company,
we also though have a lot of D, E, and I Seminars that we do talking about 
language, talking about, you know, what does, how do you reduce bias in your 
recruiting? What does it mean to, you know, take all this education and 
awareness that you get and put it into action in the workplace, right?
And those are seminars that are for everyone as well, whether it doesn't matter 
where you are in your journey. Because for those who actually think that, Hey, I 
am an advocate, I am a ally, you know, one of the things that we talk 
about in one of the seminars, is that how do you go from being an ally to an advocate?
Because ally-ship is very passive, right? And ally is saying, I'm not going to 
cause you harm, which is good. Right? We don't want people to cause [00:40:00] 
each other harm, but an advocate, it says, not only am I not going to cause you 
harm, but I'm going to, through action, stick up for those who have been 
marginalize. And through action,
you know, create a platform and uplift those who have 
been marginalized and know that like they may not have access to all the same 
opportunities as you. And so how do you use your privilege in that way to be an 
advocate? And so it doesn't matter where you're at in your journey.
There's something that we all need to continue to educate. Because, it's not a 
sprint and it's not a marathon either. I hear that a lot of like, oh, it's not a 
sprint, it's a marathon. No, it's actually not a marathon because for those of 
us who have run a marathon, there is a destination, right. When we're very happy 
about that, but there's no destination for this.
We have to continue to do this work. And you know, the other thing that I tell 
folks is one of the reasons I love, I love this work is because as long as 
there's a majority, there will always be a minority. And what's interesting 
though, is that as time goes on, those audiences and those groups have changed 
and they've evolved.
And so it's, and that means that we always have to continue to the work to 
understand who are the minority groups that we need to ensure that we are paying 
attention to, that we are representing them, and that they are having equitable 
experiences, just like everyone else. 
[00:41:15] 
 
**Michaela:** Is there something that you would say to my listeners, that they 
should take away from this episode?
What is like the one tip that they can do? Maybe from both of you. So we have two 
tips for them that they can go and start doing just today and in their workplace 
to make it better and nicer for everybody.
[00:41:37]  
 
**Kim:** Sure. I think if you can distinguish between bias, prejudice, and 
bullying and respond to bias, which is just not meaning it with an I statement, 
which invites the other person. And to understand things from your perspective, 
respond to prejudice with an It statement. Cause prejudice is a conscious 
belief. The person means what they say. And so you need to show them where
the boundary is. They can believe whatever they want. They can do or say whatever 
they want. So, an It statement can appeal to the law. It is illegal and it can 
appeal to an HR policy. It's a violation of HR policy, or it can appeal to 
common sense.
And it's ridiculous, you know, to refuse to hire a woman, for example, and 
then last but not least with bullying, which is being mean, respond to it with a 
You statement. You can't talk to me like that. 
[00:42:25] 
 
**Michaela:** Okay. I like that. Very, very concrete. Cool. Do you know one thing 
that you would want tip that you could give me?
[00:42:32]


**Trier:** Yeah. So I think it's really interesting. And Kim is the one who really 
pushed and challenged me on this, is that I've always said that Kim empathy is 
the catalyst for change in this space. And Kim would say, We need more 
compassion. And I was like, I want more empathy. And then I really 
had to understand the difference between empathy and compassion.
And so I still do believe that empathy is a catalyst for change, but the change 
actually occurs through compassion. And the difference is that empathy is 
yes, you are putting yourself in that person's shoes. You're understanding what 
that person is going through, but compassion is you wanting to,
through action, take that pain away, take that suffering your way, do something 
about it. And so it's, I think that it's a journey, right? There was something 
that I saw about how you go from feeling sorry for someone and having pity to 
having sympathy, to having empathy and compassion. And so what I would encourage 
your listeners is to say, where are you in that journey?
And to really strive to get to compassion, which means that, you know, that's 
showing up through action and then understanding what that action is. 
[00:43:54] 
 
**Michaela:** Yeah, thank you. I really like it. Great. Thank you so much, you 
both for taking the time, being on my show. I really enjoyed it. I

[00:44:14] 
 
 
**Kim:**  Bye. 
[00:44:15] 
 
**Michaela:** I hope you enjoyed another episode of the Software Engineering Unlocked 
podcast. Don't forget to subscribe, and I'll talk to you again in two weeks. Bye.
